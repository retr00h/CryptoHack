# To acheive a keyed permutation that is infeasible to invert without the key,
# AES applies a large number of ad-hoc mixing operations on the input.
# This is in stark contrast to public-key cryptosystems like RSA, which
# are based on elegant individual mathematical problems.
# AES is much less elegant, but it's very fast.
