# In the last challenge, you saw how XOR worked at the level of bits.
# In this one, we're going to cover the properties of the XOR operation
# and then use them to undo a chain of operations that have encrypted a flag.
# Gaining an intuition for how this works will help greatly when you come
# to attacking real cryptosystems later, especially in the block ciphers category.
